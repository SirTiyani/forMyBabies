1. Fight 

Eish it's shame about racial fights. I aint about those. I'm not taking sides, I vote zero period. But I am concerned cause like it or not i am effected by it, indirectly. so are you. So i thought my do we keep fighting black and white. And i know. 

We can't express ourselves effectively, to avoid a fight. For example
white guy: i will beat you to a pulp.. Done
Black guy: Beat who, will see about that. SEE is an invitation

on the other hand. Black vs Black
guy1: I will knock you out ... hehe
guy2: ngizok'phula flat flat flat... i'll turn you into an ironing board


2. Everyone has a dark side
Not a dark past, a dark side. congratulations if is not on record. you did well to enclosure it. It's on that fateful moment that you are tested and there's a thin line between walking away and unleashing the hulk. But sometimes happen in between which i think the one's who failed to contain it knew exactly what they were doing. So if you want to truly know someone. give them a wheel, and take them to the streets of jozi. road rage brings the truth out of people.

for instance road rage. shoot the tires
